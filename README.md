## 🧠 DSA Concepts Used

- **HashMap**: To store and access student records using roll number as the key.
- **Comparator & Sorting**: Used to sort students by name or marks.
- **List & Iteration**: To traverse all students for displaying or sorting.
- **Conditionals**: For input validation and logic decisions.

## 🖥️ GUI Components

- `JTextField` for Name, Roll No, and Marks input
- `JTextArea` for displaying student list
- `JButton` for actions like Add, Search, Delete, Sort
- `JOptionPane` for popups (input/output dialogs)

---

## ✅ How to Run

1. Clone/download the project
2. Open in any Java IDE (like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, NetBeans)
3. Ensure JDK 17+ is installed
4. Run the `Main.java` file
